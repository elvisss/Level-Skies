Please read that sections of the help document for more info.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="legal " id="cookie-policy"><h2>Do you use cookies?</h2><p>Please read our <a class="orange" class="ps" href="../../../../privacy-and-cookie-policy">privacy and cookie policy</a>.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="legal flex-fare " id="credit-card"><h2>Do you store my credit card info?</h2><p>We do not store any credit card numbers, CVV codes, or expiration dates.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="user-interface flex-fare " id="decision-time"><h2>What does decision time mean?</h2><p>We define decision time as the allotment of time between the point when you purchase your Flex Fare and the final date that you need to know your travel plans. Currently our product is designed to provide decision time in increments of 1 week intervals up to 4 weeks. Decision time is limited by your departure date so be aware that in some cases only 1 week of decision time is allowed.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="user-interface benefits flex-fare faq " id="date-flexibility"><h2>What does date flexibility mean? How is this option helpful?</h2><p>Date flexibility is one of the more interesting and useful features of our Flex Fare product. Our date flexibility feature is different from the +/-3 search option on many online travel agent (OTAs) websites. Our product can be applied to a range of dates, as opposed to the option that OTAs provide which is simply a search for individual prices over a range of dates. Said in another way, our Flex Fare price is a single price that applies to any combination of dates across a date range. Your Flex Fare is valid on any combinations of the date ranges you selected. Just send us your confirmation or itinerary after booking and we'll send you your payout if prices have gone up.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="user-interface flex-fare " id="3-week-limitation"><h2>Why can't I choose a flight that is less than three weeks away?</h2><p>We can't provide airline tickets from a Flex Fare for departure dates that are two weeks away. Our basic product comes with a one week decision time period. This means that departure dates for Flex Fares have to be a minimum of three weeks from the search date.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="user-interface flex-fare " id="date-flexibility-limitation"><h2>Can I choose more than 3 days of flexibility?</h2><p>For now the limit is a three day range. We have plans to increase that but have to figure out a few other things first. This is a medium priority item on our to-do list. Check back soon!</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="user-interface flex-fare " id="2-week-limit"><h2>Why do I have to decide on my flight at least two weeks before departure?</h2><p>The two week period before a departure date tends to be the most difficult to predict. The risk to our business is too great to provide our service in that date range.</p><p>Our market research indicates that most travelers don't traveler that last minute and those that do aren't usually undecided about their plans. We apologize to those people who would find our service useful but would need to wait to decide their plans closer than two weeks before the departure date. We'd like to figure out a way to serve everyone but meeting this specific use case is not a priority at the moment and may not be possible.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="user-interface flex-fare faq " id="reservation-period"><h2>How long can a customer reserve an airfare with Level Skies?</h2><p>We currently give customers the option of holding a Level Skies deposit for up to four weeks.</p><p>There is a correlation between the length of time that a locked fare may be held and the price we charge to lock it in. We want to offer a range of products that fit all of our customers' needs. For example, someone who wants two weeks of decision time will probably have a lower Flex Fare Price than a customer who wants to lock in an airfare for four weeks.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="user-interface " id="ui-decision-time"><h2>Why can't I click to get more decision time?</h2><p>The amount of decision time that we can provide is based on when your departure date is relative to the date that the search was made. Our product requires that travelers decide their travel plans and choose their flight at least two weeks before the actual travel date. Every Flex Fare has a minimum of one week of decision time. This means that the earliest date from the search date that a departure can take place is three weeks from the search date. Each incremental extra week that a search is made before the departure date adds a potential extra week of decision time. For example, if your departure date is 5 weeks from today you will have the option of 1, 2, or 3 weeks of decision time but not 4 weeks because then the decision could be made 1 week before the actual departure.</p><p>Our user interface automatically disables the option to select invalid decision times based on the chosen departure date on the calendar.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="flex-fare " id="purchase-ticket-now"><h2>I just want a ticket now, can I purchase through you without buying a Flex Fare?</h2><p>Not at the moment. Very soon we will also offer immediate ticket booking for those people who know their plans already. However, providing regular tickets as an online ticketing vendor is not our core offering.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="flex-fare " id="flex-fare-full-refund"><h2>I changed my mind about buying a Flex Fare. Can I get a full refund?</h2><p>Sorry, we cannot provide full refunds for Flex Fares purchased. We try to provide a number of opportunities for customers to review information. If there was a mistake with the purchase you made just let us know and we'll help you out.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="flex-fare " id="multiple-flex-fares"><h2>I'd like to buy multiple Flex Fares, is there a way for me to do this without making multiple transactions?</h2><p>No, not at the moment. This is one of our higher priority items and we should have this finished in the near future.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="flex-fare " id="multi-day-flex-fare-prices"><h2>Why are prices higher on the multi-day Flex Fare?</h2><p>Our multi-day Flex Fare offering is one of the more powerful and beneficial aspects of our product. On certain routes and certain date ranges the Locked Fare may be quite a bit higher than the current flight prices for a combination of travel dates. Certain days are often much more expensive than other days. For instance, Friday and Sunday tend to be the most expensive to travel on. If a date range contains an expensive travel date it may skew the Flex Fare price upwards. We're currently exploring different ways to handle situations like these and will continue to update our product to better handle them.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="flex-fare " id="accidental-expiration"><h2>My Flex Fare expired but I wanted to use it. Can I still do so?</h2><p>If you booked your ticket before the Flex Fare expired it is not a problem. Just send us your confirmation, even if the Flex Fare expired. If you hadn't booked your ticket by the time the Flex Fare expired, you won't be able to use it. Unfortunately we have to draw the line somewhere. We provided the decision time which is risky for us. If we budge beyond the original decision period we put ourselves at even more risk. For this reason we've decided to take a pretty hard stance for now on being flexible in case like this. We will be incorporating email alert fairly soon to help avoid accidental Flex Fare expirations.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="flex-fare " id="change-flex-fare-dates"><h2>Can I change my dates for a Flex Fare that I already purchased?</h2><p>Not at the moment, but probably soon. There is no reason why we can't offer this as an extra perk to our service. We have to be careful, however, because the mechanics of our product on the back end is inherently complicated and we have to be certain that we are able to make these kinds of offers. We are currently analyzing this idea and will likely to come to a final decision about it soon. We think this is a pretty positive offering and would love to provide it.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="flex-fare faq " id="receive-airline-ticket"><h2>When do I get my actual airline ticket?</h2><p>You book your ticket whenever you want and with whomever you want. Just make sure to book before the Flex Fare expires if you want to be eligible to receive a payout if prices have increased.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="benefits flex-fare " id="upwards-price-protection"><h2>How does a Flex Fare protect me from upwards price movement?</h2><p>If you've purchased a Flex Fare and market trends show prices jumping, you have nothing to worry about. The Flex Fare provides price protection on the day's lowest fares. If today's low fares have increased since you bought your Flex Fare we will pay you the difference once you book your flight.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="flex-fare " id="flex-fare-price"><h2>How is the price of a Flex Fare determined?</h2><p>We can't divulge our secret sauce, sorry. Here's what we can tell you: We can tell you that we have a super sharp team that has spent a considerable amount of time building our custom pricing engine. Essentially, we study historical pricing trends and mix in a number of other parameters to create a lovely pricing recipe that allows us to accurately forecast how prices will move in the future. This allows us to set the price of our Flex Fare product at a fair level that benefits our users and allows us to continue to run this business.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="benefits flex-fare faq " id="no-obligations"><h2>Does a customer have an obligation to buy a ticket if she locks in a fare?</h2><p>No. To book or not to book... there is no consequence. Once a customer has bought a Flex Fare she may apply it towards a ticket whenever she wants to (within the Decision Time) if ticket prices have gone up. If she decides not to travel or tickets prices go down, no sweat, no action is required. This is ideal for the traveler with a busy schedule who cannot commit to purchasing a ticket far in advance. We offer our customers total freedom whether to book or not book a ticket after purchasing a Flex Fare.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="flex-fare misc " id="one-way-flex-fare"><h2>Do you offer Flex Fares on one-way flights?</h2><p>We don't offer Flex Fares on one-way flights at this time. We'd like to be able to offer this at some point in the future but we think that it is a pretty low priority since the majority of people don't travel one way. For those that do, we would like to provide our service for you as well but we aren't sure exactly when that will be. Sorry!</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="how-to misc " id="buy-extra-tickets"><h2>I want to buy extra tickets after I use my Flex Fare. How can I do this?</h2><p>This is one of the top priorities for us right now. We are doing our best to integrate this feature into our product but have a ton of other things to focus on as well. We will have this feature available soon though so please check back before your next trip.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="how-to " id="how-to-use-flex-fare"><h2>How do I use my Flex Fare?</h2><p>Using a Flex Fare is easy. After you've purchased it, you'll have until it expires to book a ticket from your favorite travel agency or airline. Once you do, just forward us your confirmation or itinerary and we'll send you a payout if prices of the lowest arifare have increased. Although you don't have to, you can check current payout levels from the '<a class="orange" href="../../../../dashboard">My Locked Fares</a>' section to see what you will receive if you send us your itenerary that day.</p><p>If you're interested, we'll also send you daily updates on the fare you locked in so you can know if prices are generally going up or down while you wait to book your ticket.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="how-to " id="how-to-make-feature-requests"><h2>I want more features and options! How can I make feature requests?</h2><p>We're always happy to get feedback on our product or to hear your ideas for other products that we might be able to offer. Our goal is to create something that really benefits travelers so please let us know how to improve. The best way to let us know which features you'd like to be added is to send us an email from our <a class="orange" class="ps" href="../../../../contact">contact</a> page.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="misc " id="flex-fare-vs-price-alert"><h2>What is the difference between a Level Skies Flex Fare and a price alert system?</h2><p>A price alert system informs customers when the system thinks it is time to buy a ticket. Alerts are based on whether the price has either dropped significantly or is predicted to increase. Level Skies locks in a ticket price so that customers no longer have to worry about prices rising and can choose at their convenience when and if to redeem their deposit for a ticket (within the period that the deposit is valid). Using Level Skies, you are holding the price of a ticket so that you can wait to make up your mind or plan better versus aiming to purchase a ticket experiencing a dip the instant an alert is received. However, we do have an optional alert system built into our platform so if you want to receive alerts on your Flex Fare you can. Although, our alert system can't be use without purchasing a Flex Fare at this time.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="api " id="api-access"><h2>Can I connect to the Level Skies API right now to offer this product on my website?</h2><p>We built our API separately from our consumer platform. We used our own platform as a testing ground for our API, from which we learned a lot about it being used as a service. We are currently improving the design and stability and will make it&nbsp;available for businesses to use in the near future.</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="misc " id="other-products"><h2>Do you offer any other products?</h2><p>We don't have other products at this time but we have a number of great ideas in the pipeline that we hope to roll out soon. Oh time... why must you be so elusive, always slipping through our fingers into the future?</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="how-to misc " id="how-to-decide"><h2>Do you have more information to help me decide if this product is right for me?</h2><p>One of our goals is to provide products and services that provide peace of mind and assurance when planning for travel. This includes informing our customers about our product in a transparent way and pointing them to other resources which can allow them to better ascertain if our product fits their use case. We are working on building tools to assist with this and are compiling other helpful external&nbsp;resources but for now all we can provide is the information in this help section. We've tried to make it as informative as possible and are busting our butts to make everything better. We have a million things to do right now so please check back later for updates. Thanks!</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="misc faq " id="level-skies"><h2>What does Level Skies do?</h2><p>We give travelers peace of mind while they plan their trip by letting them lock in the day's lowest ticket price for up to a month while they decide on their travel dates and book their flight. If the price of the lowest airfare have increased since buying a Flex Fare, we will send the customer a payout for the difference once we receive their flight confirmation or itinerary.</p><p>Our service is great because the uncertain flyer no longer has to worry about rising prices or picking travel dates before she is ready. Expensive change fees and cancellation fees are now a thing of the past.&nbsp;</p></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="benefits faq " id="benefits"><h2>What are the benefits to buying a Flex Fare?</h2><p>The Level Skies Flex Fare provides a number of benefits to the average consumer. In a single word, we provide customers with flexibility and price protection when planning for travel.</p><ul><li>Date flexibility - T<span>he date flexibility option for departure and return dates allows people to reserve an airfare before knowing which exact dates they want to travel.</span>&nbsp;If you know you want to travel somewhere and you know roughly when you want to travel, you can buy a Flex Fare and choose your exact travel dates later. This helps to protect you when uncertain plans might require that you need to change your travel dates and therefore pay an airline change fee.</li><li>Price Protection - Our product is desired to protect you against the often wild price fluctuations in the airline ticketing industry. We know it's painful to see prices rise hundreds of dollars in a single day and we'd like to level out the price fluctuations for our customers. If the market prices on the day's lowest fares have increased we will pay you the difference after you book your ticket. It's that simple.</li><li>Book Later - If your plans fall through, you change your mind about traveling, or you need to drastically change your travel dates, you will be glad you simply bought a Flex Fare rather than an actual ticket. We reduce the pressure you feel to book your flight early which means fewer ticket cancelations.</li><li>Book Where You Want - Our service doesn't require you book your tickets at any particular place. If you have a favorite site or know the best place to get deals that's fine by us. Just send your confirmation or itinerary to <a class="orange" class="email ld" data-mailto="sales" href="mailto:sales@levelskies.com">sales@levelskies.com</a> to receive your payout if the day's lowest fares have increased.</li></ul></div><div style="" class="faq-item" data-tags="flex-fare faq " id="how-this-works"><h2>How does this work?</h2><p>Level Skies offers flexible airfare price protection (Flex Fares) so you can relax while you figure out your travel plans.
